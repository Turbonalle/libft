# libft

Hello world!

This is my version of libft. I'm making this repository partly because it helps me keep working on the project both from school and from home, and partly to practise using github.

There will probably be plenty of errors in the code as i go, but once it's passed the tests, the code should be working flawlessly. Although, there will be plenty of room for optimization after that.

Hopefully this will help me get on track with coding, and maybe help a few people learn something about coding.

Cheers!
